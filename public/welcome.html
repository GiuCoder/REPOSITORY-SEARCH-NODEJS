            Hey there! 👋 Welcome to "Check The Repository" website! This site
            is all about helping you check whether a GitHub repository exists or
            not. It's a simple tool, but it can save you lots of time and effort
            if you're not sure whether the repository you're looking for is out
            there. All you need to do is type in the repository name, hit the
            "Check Repository" button, and wait for the result! 🕵️‍♀️ It's that
            easy! Plus, we've added a little trick to prevent spam, so make sure
            to leave the honeypot field blank! We hope you find this website
            helpful and straightforward to use! 🤞 If you have any questions,
            suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
            We'd love to hear from you and improve our tool as much as we can.
            Oh, and don't forget to check out our YouTube channel for more
            tech-related content! 👨‍💻 We regularly post new videos and tutorials,
            so be sure to subscribe and stay up-to-date with the latest tech
            news. Thanks for stopping by, and we hope you have a fantastic day!
