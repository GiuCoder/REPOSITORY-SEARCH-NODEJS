Repository Search NodeJS for search Github repository


# Search The Repository

Search The Repository is a web application built with Express.js that allows users to search for repositories on GitHub. The application uses the GitHub API to search for repositories and display information about them, such as the repository name, description, creation date, license, language, owner email, source, and IP address.

The application includes a rate limiter middleware to prevent excessive requests from a single IP address. If a user makes too many requests in a 15-minute window, they will receive an error message and be asked to try again later.

To prevent spam bots from using the application, a honeypot field has been added to the search form. If the honeypot field is filled out, the application assumes the user is a bot and displays an error message.

If a user enters a repository name that does not exist on GitHub, the application will return a 404 error page.

# Getting Started

To use the application, simply enter a repository name in the search form on the homepage and click the "Search" button. If the repository exists on GitHub, the application will display information about it. If the repository does not exist, the application will display a 404 error page.
